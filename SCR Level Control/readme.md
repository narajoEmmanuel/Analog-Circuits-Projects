# SCR-based Level Control
This repository covers a lab project on SCR-based level control at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology.

### Simulation
1. Used Proteus for waveform analysis.
2. Detailed component functions based on graphs.
3. Simulated with C1=2ÂµF, explained observations.

### Protoboard
1. Assembled neatly, provided photos, and a short demo video.
2. Measured voltages for 15 potentiometer points.
3. Measured voltages and bulb brightness, created graphs, and commented.

### Prototype Card
1. Soldered meticulously, shared detailed photos, and a short video.
