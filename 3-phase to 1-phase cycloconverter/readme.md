# Three-Phase to Single-Phase Cycloconverter
This repository documents a power electronics project conducted at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology, focusing on the study and simulation of a three-phase to single-phase cycloconverter using PSpice AD. The project explores various parameters, including voltage, power factor (FP), total harmonic distortion (THD), and efficiency under different load conditions.

## Project Summary

In power electronics, various configurations are employed to regulate voltage drop across the load, impacting power delivery. Thyristor families and other power components are used to obtain inverters, rectifiers, and controllers with fixed or variable frequency. 

This project specifically delves into the study of a three-phase to single-phase cycloconverter. 

The simulation, conducted in PSpice AD, involves testing different parameters to analyze voltage stability and power regulation at varying input and output frequencies without the need for an intermediary device.


### Objectives
 - Design a three-phase to single-phase cycloconverter in PSpice.
 - Utilize semiconductor devices for power management.
 - Implement a power quality analysis of the cycloconverter.
 - Observe correlations between operating conditions and quality parameters.
