# Electronic Control of Kohler 15 KW Mobile Generator

## Overview

This repository documents a power electronics project carried out at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology, focusing on the electronic control of a Kohler 15 KW mobile generator. The project involved presenting the findings, objectives, theoretical foundations, detailed solutions, results, and conclusions related to power electronics.


## Featured Thesis: "Electronic Control of Kohler 15 KW Mobile Generator"

This section summarizes the relevant concepts from the graduation thesis titled "Electronic Control of Kohler 15 KW Mobile Generator" by Engineer Esteban Ram√≠rez Gonzalez.

- The thesis addresses the critical role of electrical energy, especially in medical and mega-industrial processes, emphasizing the need for alternative power sources as emergency plans.
- The thesis focuses on the development of an electronic control method for a Kohler generator powered by an internal combustion engine.

## Key Conclusions

1. Successfully implemented an electronic controller meeting the requirements of the Kohler 15 KW mobile generator.
2. Mathematically expressed the relationship between the generator's excitation current and the generated voltage.
3. Developed a compensator programmable in the PIC based on mathematical models of the generator.
4. Achieved voltage control through the generator's excitation current.
5. Varied the generator's excitation current based on the firing angle indicated by the control module.
6. Utilized optical devices to integrate power circuits with a low-voltage control module.
7. Implemented electronic control with a budget of 15% of the machine's value.
