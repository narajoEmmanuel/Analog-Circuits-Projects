# Solid State Relay Project
This repository covers a project on Solid State Relays (SSR) at the Costa Rica Institute of Technology, focusing on analog electronics and power electronics.

## Project Report

1. **Solid State Relay (SSR) Introduction**
   - Definition and operation of SSR.
   - Comparison with electromechanical relays.
   - Components and functions in an SSR circuit.

2. **Optocoupler Investigation**
   - Research of parameters: VISO, IF, VR, VDRM, ITSM, VF, VTM, and IFT.
   - Characteristics of optotransistor, optotriac, and optodarlington.
   - Table comparing SSRs and electromechanical relays.

3. **Commercial SSRs**
   - Research of two commercial SSRs, detailing their operation, features, and applications.

4. **CD Load Behavior**
   - Investigated why a connected DC load remains active after the first gate pulse, with or without zero-crossing optocoupler.

5. **Component Functions**
   - Explained the roles of D1, D2, D4, and Q1 in Figure 2.
   - Enumerated the functions of all other circuit components.

6. **Snubber Networks**
   - Determined the voltage rating for capacitors in case of snubber implementation.
